This is a little experiment that I did while attending RubyConfUy 2011 for a lightning talk about Responsive Web Design.

This experiment explicitly shows the capability of @media for content control over differently sized viewports; try resizing your browser window or accessing this page through your mobile device or tablet device.

While it may seem this experiment makes use of Javascript, it does not :)
